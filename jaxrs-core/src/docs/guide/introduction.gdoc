The @jaxrs@ project is a set of Grails plugins that supports the development of RESTful web services based on the Java
API for RESTful Web Services (JSR 311: JAX-RS).

It is targeted at developers who want to structure the web service layer of an application in a JSR 311 compatible way
but still want to continue to use Grails' powerful features such as GORM, automated XML and JSON marshalling, Grails
services, Grails filters and so on. This plugin is an alternative to Grails' built-in mechanism for implementing RESTful
web services.
