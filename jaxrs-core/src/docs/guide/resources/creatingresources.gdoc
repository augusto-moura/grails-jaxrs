Any @*Resource.groovy@ file created under grails-app/resources is assumed to be a JAX-RS resource and auto-detected by the
*jaxrs* plugin. These resources are checked for the presence of JAX-RS annotations as defined by JAX-RS 1.1
specification, section 3.1. Resources that aren't properly annotated are ignored by the plugin.

{note}When running applications locally, resource classes are watched and reloaded when any change to them occurs.{note}
