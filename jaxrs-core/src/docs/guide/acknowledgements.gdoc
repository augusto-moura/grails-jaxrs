The *jaxrs* plugin has a long history and has had many contributions. This section will serve to acknowledge those
contributions and give proper credit and thanks for everyone's work.

The biggest thanks go to [Martin Krasser|https://github.com/krasserm],
[Davide Cavestro|https://github.com/davidecavestro], and [Noam Y. Tenne|https://github.com/noamt] for their work on the
development and maintenance of the plugin. The plugin may have gone through some structural changes, but the code and
logic is either mostly intact or derived from their work. Additionally, the documentation includes significant sections
of the original plugin documentation from the [GitHub wiki|https://github.com/krasserm/grails-jaxrs/wiki].

Thank you also to [Donald Jackson|https://github.com/donald-jackson] for his work on starting the adaption of the plugin
for Grails 3.
