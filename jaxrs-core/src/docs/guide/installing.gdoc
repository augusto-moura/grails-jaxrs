The plugin itself is split into several smaller plugins. The *jaxrs-core* plugin contains the bulk
of the classes necessary for the plugin to work, but there are many different implementations of
JSR-311 that exist. The plugin was broken up to better manage the library dependencies that come
with adding many different implementations.

When adding the *jaxrs* plugin to an application, one of the implementation-specific plugins should
be used.

{warning}
The *jaxrs-core* plugin should not be included as a dependency of an application directly. It will
automatically be included as part of the dependencies of the implementation that is chosen.

The table below details the various plugins that are available and what they do.
